# Slashing (nothing-at-stake penalty).
#
# A TX_TYPE_SLASHING transaction is trustless evidence that one validator signed two
# conflicting blocks with the SAME stake UTXO in the SAME timeslot (equivocation). It
# is not signed: any node that observes the two conflicting stakes can build it, and
# every node builds the byte-identical transaction from the same evidence.
#
# Evidence layout (placed right after tx_type in the transaction, like a downgrade
# payload), two proofs ordered by the stake-tx hash ascending:
#
#   proof  := prev_hash(32) . pack("N", timeslot) . digest(32) . varstr(stake_tx_bytes)
#   payload:= proof[0] . proof[1]
#
# prev_hash/timeslot/digest are exactly the three components of the block's
# Block::sign_data (the message the stake signed); stake_tx_bytes is the tx-level
# serialization of the stake (its inputs with signatures, and its outputs). From
# these the verifier reconstructs the signed message and checks the signature on the
# shared input(s) - the proof that the same key endorsed two different blocks.
#
# The slashing transaction then spends the shared (equivocated) UTXOs WITHOUT a
# signature and refunds each owner scripthash its value minus SLASHING_FINE; the fine
# becomes the transaction fee (into the reward fund). Refund outputs are plain outputs
# at the owner's scripthash and so are subject to the same STAKE_MATURITY spend lock as
# stake outputs (enforced for the spender in check_input_script).
#
# A refund can be spent ONLY by a standard (or tokens) transaction: staking it again is
# consensus-invalid (Transaction::validate), and so is slashing it again
# (Transaction::validate_slashing). Equivocation means the staking setup is broken or a
# delegate is dishonest, so the punished coins are fail-stopped until the owner
# deliberately moves them. For delegated coins this is a hard stop for the delegate:
# the covenant's delegate branch only allows spending into a stake, so after one fine
# the delegate can neither keep staking the refund nor fabricate further conflicting
# stake signatures on it to grind the owner's coins down fine by fine - only the
# owner's key can free the coins.

# the user asked for: stakes linger for SLASHING_WINDOW so a later conflicting stake can
# be caught. We store a fully detached SNAPSHOT (see _snapshot_stake), NOT the live
# QBitcoin::Transaction: a live transaction holds txo objects registered (weakened) in
# the global %TXO cache, and pinning any of them here would keep the weak entry alive
# after the block is dropped - so the unconditional save in Transaction::load_txo
# collides ("Attempt to override already loaded txo") when the corresponding
# transaction is received again. This applies to the stake's outputs AND to its inputs
# (an input is the previous stake's output). Indexed by timeslot then stake-UTXO key.
